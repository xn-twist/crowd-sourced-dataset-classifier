# XN-Twist Crowd-Sourced Classification System
*Because 30 seconds can make the internet a much safer place.*

The goal of this project is to make it quick and easy to create datasets for [XN-Twist](https://github.com/fhightower/xn_twist). These datasets can then be used to give organizations around the world (many of which cannot afford large security teams) more visibility into potential threats.

## How do I get started making the world a safer place?

More details on what you can do coming shortly!

### A Note on Development

Two notes actually:

1. This is my first angular 2 project of any consequence and I would appreciate any constructive criticism (in the form of issues or pull requests would be best).
2. This project is still actively **under development**. The UI/UX is poor at best and there are a lot of really cool features I can add to make this more powerful/effective. Feel free to add any ideas as [issues](https://github.com/xn-twist/crowd-sourced-dataset-creator/issues).
